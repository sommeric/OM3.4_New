# OM3.4_New

Ops Manager 3.4 has a redesigned deployment page.  Items that previously appeared in the inner left-hand navigation bar now appear in as tabs.  They include servers and agents.  Security settings also now appear under a separate tab.  The settings include authentication & users, and authorization & roles.  The toplogy and list views are now accessed via buttons.  Additional functions are accessible under more: host mappings, version manager, and logs.
