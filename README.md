# Ops Manager 3.4 User Interface Changes

Ops Manager 3.4, released at the beginning of December, contains both new feature and changes from the previous major release, 2.0.  This blog post will focus on the new Ops Manager 3.4 UI.  It will cover new features and highlight changes from the previous UI.

## Deployment page

Ops Manager 3.4 has a redesigned deployment page.  Items that previously appeared in the inner left-hand navigation bar now appear as tabs.  Joining the existing tab for *Processes* are tabs for *Servers* and *Agents*.  Security settings also now appear under a separate *Security* tab.  These include *USERS*, *ROLES* and *AUTHORIZATION & TSL/SSL SETTINGS*.  The *TOPOLOGY* and *LIST* views are now accessed via buttons.  Additional functions are accessible under *More*: *Host Mappings*, *Version Manager*, and *Logs*.
